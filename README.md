## üõ† Developer Notes

This section is for developers who want to extend, debug, or adapt the script.

### Core Components

- **SMA Cloud**  
  A filled region between SMA1 and SMA2. The cloud is only drawn if both are enabled.  

- **SMA Length Customization**  
  Each SMA has its own configurable length input. Default values can be adjusted for short-, mid-, or long-term analysis.  

- **Visibility Controls**  
  Each SMA can be individually toggled for:  
  - **Chart plotting** (line visibility)  
  - **Table display** (inclusion/exclusion from summary table)  

- **Summary Table**  
  Displays the most recent value of each enabled SMA at the top of the chart. Colors match the plotted SMA lines.  

### Implementation Notes

- Table rendering is dynamic: disabled SMAs are excluded.  
- SMA Cloud rendering depends on SMA1 and SMA2 being visible; otherwise, no fill is drawn.
