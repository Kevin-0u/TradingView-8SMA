# SMA Cloud & Multi-SMA Indicator

This TradingView indicator lets you track up to **eight customizable Simple Moving Averages (SMAs)** in one clean view.
It’s designed to help you spot trend direction, support/resistance levels, and momentum shifts more easily.

### Key Features

- **SMA Cloud**
  A shaded cloud is drawn between the first two SMAs, making it easier to see when price is trending or consolidating.
  > Tip: If either of the first two SMAs is hidden, the cloud won’t appear.

- **Flexible Setup**
  Choose the length of each SMA to match your trading style — from short-term momentum (e.g., 5–10 bars) to long-term trend (e.g., 100–200 bars).

- **Hide What You Don’t Need**
  You can toggle each SMA on or off, both on the chart and in the summary table, keeping your screen uncluttered.

- **Color-Coded Summary Table**
  The latest SMA values are displayed at the top of the chart in an easy-to-read table.

### Why Use This Indicator?

- Quickly confirm trend direction with multiple SMAs.
- Spot bullish or bearish momentum shifts when SMAs cross and SMA cloud changes color.
- Stay organized with a clean table showing all key SMA values in real time.
